# forkify

This is a dynamic front-end project about searching many food recipes. User can enter the recipe such as pizza, pasta, cake etc and once user submit that different results related to submitted recipes would be shown on the front-page. After that User can check some specific recipe in the detail and add different ingredients into the shopping cart too. At the end, if user wants to add any recipes into the favourite section then that user can even do that too.
